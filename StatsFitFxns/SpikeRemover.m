%   2- The max acceptable proportion change in the window
%   3- The max acceptable change in SD units in the window
% This routine is pretty bone-headed. It sets to NaN any stretch of WINDOW
% measures from the data within which the data contains a max and min that
% are more than a X% signal change or Y SD of the entire time series.
% The WINDOW before and after are also set to NaN
