StimOnsetDelay=1031; % This is the delay in msecs between the onset of 
% the eye trcking time stamps and the start of the stimulus modulation.
% This duration of data is chopped from the front of each trial prior to
% the analysis to allow the phase measurements to be accurate.


TrialInspectorFlag=0; % If set, plot each time series

% Generally, only one or the other of the two harmonic flags should be set

HarmonicModelFlag=0; % If set, model in the sparkline plots the harmonic
HarmonicTestFlag=1; % If set, generate all response plots assuming harmonic stimulation

adapt_length = 300; % Duration in seconds of the initial background adaptation peiod

sampling_frequency = 20;  % The samples per second of our final data vectors
full_trial_length = 45;  % The length in seconds of the full trial
%   acquisition
final_trial_length = 40; % The length of each data trial after processing,
%   taken from the tail of each full data trial.
%    That is, we discard some data from the start of each trial.
minimum_length_trial=42; % Any trial shorter than this will be discarded

StutterErrorFlag = 0;     % If these are data from the initial TTF4D
% experiment, use a modified version of the LeastSquaresSpectralFit routine
% that accounts for the tiny error in the stimulus sinusoidal modulation
spike_remover_params(1)=10; % The window size to use for spike removal
spike_remover_params(2)=0.2; % The max acceptable proportion change in the window
spike_remover_params(3)=2; % The max acceptable change in SD units in the window
sgolay_span = 20;         % Parameters of the SGolay interpolation prior
sgolay_polynomial = 7;    %   to interpolation
BadPercentChangeThreshold = .40;       % Any time point with an absolute change from
% the mean of greater than this proportion will be NaN-ed, as it is
% certainly noise
BadNanThreshold=0.10; % If more than this proportion
% of a trial time series is composed of NaNs, discard the trial

% The setting of the Protocols variable will determine which
